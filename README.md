Agario-type game with own ideas

Agario-type game with my own invention. 

- The main goal is to gather green squares which are 'food'
- Agario grows with 0.1 after eating one square
- Agario resets to default when crossing the frame borders (You must watch out!)
- Agario resets to default after contact with "killing balls", moving ball-type objects.
- Agario becomes immortal for 10 seconds after contact with yellow square (Cannot be killed by killing balls) - this part is still in build to set the spawn time of yellow square.
